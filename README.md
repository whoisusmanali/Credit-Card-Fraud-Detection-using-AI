# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on building a **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** using various supervised learning algorithms and neural networks. The system aims to accurately detect fraudulent transactions while maintaining high performance. The project also includes robust data preprocessing, modeling, and a dashboard for data visualization and insights.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
  - Removed duplicates, missing values, and outliers.  
  - Performed feature scaling and normalization.  
  - Applied techniques such as PCA for dimensionality reduction.

- **Data Storage**:  
  - Stored processed data in a structured database for easy retrieval and analysis.

- **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**:  
  - Implemented and evaluated multiple supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.  
  - Designed and trained a neural network for enhanced fraud detection.

- **Evaluation**:  
  - Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC were used to evaluate model performance.  
  - Ensured a balance between minimizing false positives and maximizing fraud detection accuracy.

- **Dashboard Creation**:  
  - Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize transaction trends, fraud patterns, and model predictions.  
  - Dashboard provides real-time insights into transaction anomalies and fraud statistics.
